Module Assessment   Guideline: IRDR0004 (Part-B)
As   part   of   the   IRDR0004   module   assessment   (Part-B   or   Component   002),   you   are   required   to   submit   an   individual   technical   report,   which   constitutes   50%   of   the   overall module   mark.
This    coursework    will    reflect    the    skills    you      have      developed      through      the      lectures   (teaching weeks 6-10, Term I), computer lab tutorials, and independent learning.   You   are strongly encouraged to dedicate sufficient time to practicing   in the   computer   labs,   attending   office   hours,   and   seeking   guidance   from   the   module   team, which   includes   the module lead and postgraduate   teaching   assistants   (PGTAs).
The    lectures   will    primarily    cover   theoretical    concepts,   while   the    computer   cluster   sessions will provide practical experience in an interactive and engaging environment.   To    enhance    your    understanding,   you    should    complement    classroom    learning    by   reading   relevant   literature,   reviewing   practice   and   module   materials,   and   watching   supplementary videos as part of your independent study.
The assessment will test your core competencies in   Geographic   Information Systems   (GIS)   and   remote   sensing   (RS)   tools   and   techniques,   requiring   you   to   apply   these   skills   effectively   in   your   analysis   and   interpretation.   For   your   project,   adopt   a   clear,   focused,   and   well-articulated   approach.   Define   your   project   aim   and   objectives   in   a   scientific and structured manner to   ensure clarity and   purpose   in your work.

2.1. Example   Used in   Practical   Labs:
In   our computer   practical   labs,   we   examined   Land   Cover   Change   Detection   in the   Kutupalong      Refugee      Camps      in      Cox’s      Bazar,      Bangladesh,    focusing    on      the   transformation    of    land      cover      following      the       influx    of       nearly      a       million      displaced   populations between 2017 and 2022. However, this specific example cannot be used   for your assessment as it was covered during classroom   instruction.
2.2. Steps to   Follow
i.             Select    a    Study    Area    and    Topic:    Choose    a    topic    related    to    disaster    risk   reduction   or   humanitarian   crises.   Ensure   the   study   area   is   manageable   and   relevant   to   the   module’s   themes.   Also,   ensure   the   chosen   area   aligns   with   a   recognised   administrative   boundary,   facilitating   reproducibility   and   integration   with official data   sources.
ii.             Download    Relevant    Data:   Acquire    the    study   area    boundary   shapefile   and   appropriate   Landsat 8 satellite images.
iii.             Produce    Land   Cover   Maps:   Create   land   cover   maps   for   two   distinct   time   periods, ensuring a gap of at least 5   to   10 years   between   them.
iv.             Calculate    NDVI:    Perform   a    Normalised   Difference   Vegetation    Index   (NDVI)   analysis for both time   periods.
v.             Calculate Land Surface Temperature (LST): Derive land surface temperature   for the two time periods to observe   changes.
vi.             Incorporate   Additional    Data:    Incorporate   additional   geospatial   or   statistical   datasets from credible secondary sources for advanced analysis.
vii.             Write the Technical Report:   Prepare your   report following this   guideline.

8.1. Importance of Selecting an Appropriate Study   Area for Landsat   8 Analysis
Selecting   an   appropriate   study   area   is   critical   for   ensuring   the   effectiveness   and   accuracy   of   the   analysis   when   using   Landsat   8   images.   Several   factors   must   be   considered to optimise the results and minimise   potential   challenges:
a)    Resolution   of   Landsat   8   Images:
            Landsat   8   provides   moderate   spatial   resolution, with   most   bands   at   30   metres   per   pixel.   This   resolution   is   well-suited   for   analysing   medium-   sized   cities   or   urban   areas,   as   it   captures   significant   patterns   without   overwhelming computational resources.
         Too    Small    Areas:       If    the      study      area       is    too      small       (e.g.,    a      single   neighbourhood),   the resolution maybe insufficient   to capture meaningful   variations or details, leading to   poor results.
         Too Large   Areas:   Very large areas may require multiple scenes   to   cover   the extent, increasing the complexity of data handling   and   analysis.
b)      Extent of Change:
            Medium-sized   cities   or   urban   areas   experiencing   noticeable   land   cover   changes   over   time   (e.g.,   urban   expansion,   deforestation,   or   disaster   impacts) are ideal.   Areas with minimal changes may not provide enough   variability to analyse effectively.
c)      Availability of Imagery:
            Landsat   8   provides   consistent   coverage   since   11   February   2013,   but   availability   of   cloud-free   scenes   can   vary,   especially    in    regions   with   frequent cloud cover. Choosing a location with accessible, clear imagery   reduces the risk of gaps   in analysis.
d)    Dealing with   Multiple   Scenes:
            If   the study area spans multiple Landsat scenes, you must ensure proper   mosaicking   (using   the   ‘Merge’   tool)   and   alignment.   This   can   introduce   complexity and potential errors in analysis,   especially for   beginners.
e)    Seasonal Variations:
            Land    cover    can    vary    significantly   with    seasons,    especially    in    areas   affected   by   agriculture,   vegetation   cycles,   or   snow.   Selecting   imagery   from   comparable   seasons   (e.g.,   summer-to-summer   comparisons)   is   crucial to avoid seasonal bias   in   the   results.
f)         Data   Processing Complexity:
            Large   or   complex   areas   might   require   advanced   techniques,   such   as   atmospheric    correction    or      cloud      masking,    which      can      be      resource-   intensive.      A      balanced      approach      ensures      that      you      can      focus      on   meaningful analysis without being overwhelmed by data preparation.
By considering these factors, you can ensure that your chosen study   area   aligns well   with the capabilities of Landsat 8 and the objectives of   their analysis, leading to more   accurate and meaningful   results.
